I have created a simple Linear Regression Model using Machine Learning in Julia Programming Language. I have two types of code in the file that is one using Machine Learning and the other one involves in using GLM module for comparing whether both the regression lines are same. I have a dataset attached here but in two files where one is unnormalised and the other one is normalised. Normalised Datasets will give you accurate Regression Line. Using Andrew Ng's cost function and partial derivative function formulas to create this Linear Regression Model.
